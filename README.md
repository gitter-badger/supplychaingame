The Supply Chain Game is a fast-paced, fun tower building competition (similar to Jenga) that teaches cyber supply chain principles. The game was designed and developed for the Supply Chain Sandbox at the 2020 RSA Conference. 

## Original rules
* A team consists of three players. Each player takes turns placing a block, representing an individual component, on the stack.
* A layer consists of three components (unless otherwise noted). 
* After each player has placed one component (unless otherwise noted), the team draws one card from the deck and plays it.
* Gameplay continues until the tower falls.
* (There are no win conditions)

## Revised rules
* Teams do NOT have to play cards when drawn, and can only have (players+1) cards at any time. Teams must play one before drawing a card that would cause them to exceed that number.
* Teams consist of a CEO, CIO, and CISO, each of which has a different "super power" and a different win condition.
* The CEO goes first, can direct the CIO to start a new layer at any time, and wins at a height of ten layers.
* The CIO goes second, removes all components, and wins after six consecutive rounds without collapse.
* The CISO goes last (and draws cards), may replace components anywhere in the stack during their turn, and wins if the stack never collapses.
* If the stack collapses, remove the out of place components and keep building.
* All three players can win.

## Variants
#### Start with an SBOM
* The die has two sides painted red, indicating this type of component is particularly troublesome, and no green side, indicating this type of component is more robust.
* Components are blindly drawn from a box, and participants can choose to avoid playing a component they drew and add it to a "discard" pile, consuming one turn.
* (Savvy participants may choose to play this piece in a strategically strong place, so they can build faster and maintain resilience)

#### Mature Cyber Supply Chain Program
* The die has two sides of three colors, indicating the other components are known to be less likely to fail, due to supply chain diligence. 
* Components are blindly drawn from a box, and participants can choose to avoid playing a component they drew and add it to a "discard" pile, consuming one turn.
* (Savvy participants may choose to play this piece in a strategically strong place, so they can build faster and maintain resilience)
